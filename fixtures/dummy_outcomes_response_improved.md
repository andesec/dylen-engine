<!-- 
Improvement over original:
- Level 1 (Recognition): "identify the relationship" with real-world context
- Level 2 (Application): "calculate" with concrete scenario (vehicle)
- Level 3 (Analysis): "diagnose" the inverse relationship 
- Level 4 (Synthesis): "design an experiment" showing mastery

Each outcome:
✅ Uses strong action verb
✅ Includes specific context
✅ Is measurable/observable
✅ Follows scaffolding progression
✅ Avoids vague "understand" language

Blueprint: "knowledge_understanding" because this is physics theory
Teacher Persona: "Research Scientist" - experimental methodology and evidence-based learning
