# Backend Spec — Onboarding & Waitlist (FastAPI)

## Purpose
Accept a complete onboarding submission, validate it, store legal consent, and move the user into a WAITLISTED state.

---

## Authentication
- All endpoints require authenticated user
- User identity comes from auth middleware (JWT / session)
- Do NOT trust client-sent user IDs
