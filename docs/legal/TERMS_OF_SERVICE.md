# Terms of Service
**Last updated:** January 30, 2026

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Dylen (the “Service”), including our websites, applications, APIs, and related services (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

If you are using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity (an “Organization”), you represent that you have authority to bind that Organization, and “you” includes the Organization.

## 1. Who We Are
The Services are provided by Dylen (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

**Contact:** support@dylen.example  
**Mailing address:** [Company address]  

## 2. Eligibility and Accounts
You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority where you live) to use the Services, unless your Organization has authorized your use and is responsible for your activity.

You are responsible for:
- Maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and any access tokens.
- All activity that occurs under your account, to the extent permitted by law.
- Providing accurate account information and keeping it up to date.

We may suspend or terminate access if we reasonably believe your account has been compromised or used in violation of these Terms.

## 3. The Services
Dylen provides a data generation service that can process your inputs to produce outputs (including structured JSON content). The Services may include background jobs and orchestration across multiple components, including third-party AI model providers.

We may modify, discontinue, or suspend any part of the Services at any time, including to improve performance, security, or compliance.

## 4. Acceptable Use
You agree not to, and not to assist others to:
- Use the Services for unlawful, harmful, or abusive activities.
- Submit content that infringes intellectual property, privacy, or other rights.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems or accounts, or probe, scan, or test vulnerabilities except as expressly permitted in writing.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Services, including by introducing malware or excessive automated requests.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code, models, or prompts from the Services, except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by law.
- Use the Services to develop or train competing products where prohibited by applicable law or agreement.

We may implement rate limits, quotas, and other controls to protect the Services.

## 5. Your Content and Responsibilities
“Customer Content” means any content you submit to the Services, including prompts, text, files, structured data, and any materials you provide for processing.

You represent and warrant that:
- You have all rights and permissions needed to submit Customer Content.
- Your Customer Content does not violate law or these Terms.
- You will not submit sensitive personal information (e.g., medical data, financial account numbers, government IDs, or passwords) unless a feature explicitly requires it and you have a lawful basis and required consents.

## 6. AI Outputs and Limitations
The Services may generate outputs using machine learning models. You acknowledge that:
- Outputs may be incorrect, incomplete, misleading, or unsuitable for your purposes.
- You are responsible for reviewing outputs before using them, including for accuracy, safety, and compliance.
- The Services are not a substitute for professional advice (including legal, medical, financial, or safety advice).

You will not rely on the Services for high-risk decisions without appropriate human review and safeguards.

## 7. Intellectual Property
### 7.1 Our IP
We and our licensors retain all rights, title, and interest in and to the Services, including software, documentation, and any non-customer materials. These Terms do not grant you any right to use our trademarks, logos, or branding, except as expressly permitted.

### 7.2 Customer Content
As between you and us, you retain your rights in Customer Content. You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, process, transmit, and display Customer Content solely to provide, maintain, and improve the Services and to comply with law.

### 7.3 Outputs
As between you and us, you may use outputs you receive from the Services for your internal or external purposes, subject to these Terms and applicable law. We do not guarantee that outputs are unique or non-infringing.

## 8. Third-Party Services
The Services may integrate with third-party services (for example, authentication providers and AI model providers). Your use of third-party services may be governed by separate terms and policies. We are not responsible for third-party services outside our reasonable control.

## 9. Fees, Trials, and Taxes (If Applicable)
If the Services are offered with paid tiers, you agree to pay all applicable fees and taxes. Additional terms may apply to trials, discounts, renewals, and refunds, which will be presented at the time of purchase or in an Order Form.

## 10. Suspension and Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services:
- If you violate these Terms or applicable law.
- To protect the security, integrity, or availability of the Services.
- If required by law or a governmental request.

You may stop using the Services at any time. Certain provisions of these Terms survive termination, including those related to intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and dispute resolution.

## 11. Disclaimers
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, secure, error-free, or that outputs will be accurate or suitable for any particular purpose.

## 12. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:
- WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL.
- OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID US FOR THE SERVICES IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR (B) US$100.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of the above may not apply to you.

## 13. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to (a) your Customer Content, (b) your use of the Services, or (c) your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

## 14. Dispute Resolution; Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of [State/Country], without regard to conflict of law principles.

Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought exclusively in the courts located in [County/State/Country], and you consent to personal jurisdiction and venue there, except where prohibited by law.

If you are a consumer in a jurisdiction that provides mandatory consumer rights, nothing in these Terms limits those rights.

## 15. Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms and update the “Last updated” date. If changes are material, we may provide additional notice as required by law.
