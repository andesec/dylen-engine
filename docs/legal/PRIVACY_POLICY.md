# Privacy Policy
**Last updated:** January 30, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Dylen (the “Service”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you access or use our websites, applications, APIs, and related services (collectively, the “Services”). If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, do not use the Services.

If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization (an “Organization”), your Organization may have its own policies governing your use of the Services. In that case, the Organization may be the “Controller” (or equivalent) for certain processing, and we may act as a “Processor” (or equivalent) on its behalf.

## 1. Who We Are
The Services are operated by Dylen (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

**Contact:** privacy@dylen.example  
**Mailing address:** [Company address]  

## 2. Scope
This Privacy Policy applies to information we process in connection with the Services, including:
- Our web properties and applications.
- Our API and backend services (including background job processing).
- Support, communications, and operational systems.

This Privacy Policy does not cover third-party websites, products, or services that you may access through the Services.

## 3. Information We Collect
We collect information from (a) you, (b) your Organization (if applicable), (c) your devices and usage of the Services, and (d) third parties you choose to use to authenticate or integrate with the Services.

### 3.1 Account and Profile Information
Depending on how you sign up and configure your account, we may collect:
- **Identifiers and contact details:** email address; unique user identifiers (e.g., a Firebase UID or similar); authentication provider identifiers.
- **Profile details:** name, photo/avatar URL, profession, city, country, age (if provided).
- **Organization context:** organization identifiers, role and permission assignments, subscription tier information.

### 3.2 Authentication and Security Information
To provide secure access, we may process:
- **Authentication tokens/credentials:** such as identity tokens, bearer tokens, or session identifiers.
- **Security signals:** login timestamps, account status, role/permission claims, and related security events.

### 3.3 User Content and Inputs
The Services may allow you to submit content to generate outputs (for example: lesson topics, prompts, writing samples, criteria, or other text and structured data). We may process:
- **Inputs you submit** through the Services or API.
- **Generated outputs** produced by the Services (including structured JSON content).
- **Associated metadata** such as request types, agent or workflow identifiers, and job identifiers.

Important: Do not include sensitive personal information (for example: medical details, financial account numbers, government IDs, or passwords) in prompts or uploads unless the feature explicitly requires it and you have appropriate rights and consents.

### 3.4 Usage and Device Information
When you use the Services, we may collect:
- **Log data:** request timestamps, endpoints accessed, HTTP method, response status codes, error logs, and performance timing.
- **Device/network data:** IP address, user agent, and related request headers.

We design logging to reduce the likelihood of collecting sensitive information, but request payloads may be logged in some environments (for example, for debugging or audit). You should assume that content you submit may be retained in logs or audit systems as described in this policy.

### 3.5 Cookies and Similar Technologies
Depending on how the Services are deployed, we may use cookies or similar technologies:
- **Strictly necessary cookies** for security and session management (e.g., an HTTP-only session cookie).
- **Preference or functional storage** for user settings (if enabled).

Where required by law, we will provide appropriate choices and obtain consent before using non-essential cookies.

## 4. How We Use Information
We use information for the following business purposes:
- **Provide and operate the Services:** authenticate users, run workflows, generate requested outputs, and deliver results.
- **Security and fraud prevention:** protect accounts, enforce access controls, detect abuse, and maintain service integrity.
- **Reliability and performance:** monitor availability, debug issues, and improve latency and quality.
- **Product improvement:** evaluate and improve features, models, prompts, and system behavior (including by reviewing aggregated usage patterns).
- **Customer support and communications:** respond to requests, send service-related notices, and provide support.
- **Compliance and legal obligations:** meet regulatory requirements, respond to lawful requests, and enforce our agreements.

## 5. How We Share Information
We may share information in the following circumstances:

### 5.1 Service Providers and Subprocessors
We use third-party providers to help operate the Services. Depending on configuration, these may include:
- **Authentication/identity providers** (e.g., Firebase/Google) to verify identity.
- **AI model providers** (e.g., Gemini, OpenRouter, Vertex AI, or similar) to process your inputs and generate outputs.
- **Infrastructure providers** for hosting, databases, logging, monitoring, and storage.
- **Email and messaging providers** to deliver service notifications.

We share information with these providers only as needed to provide the Services, subject to contractual protections appropriate to the context (such as confidentiality obligations and data processing terms where applicable).

### 5.2 Within Your Organization
If you use the Services through an Organization account, authorized Organization administrators may be able to access certain account information and usage data, subject to your Organization’s settings and policies.

### 5.3 Legal, Safety, and Enforcement
We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to:
- Comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental requests.
- Protect the rights, property, and safety of the Company, our users, or others.
- Investigate or prevent fraud, security issues, or technical problems.
- Enforce our Terms of Service and other agreements.

### 5.4 Business Transfers
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will provide notice if required by law.

## 6. AI Processing and Model Providers
The Services may send your inputs to third-party AI model providers to generate outputs. These providers may process your inputs and outputs to deliver the requested functionality.

Your responsibilities:
- You are responsible for ensuring you have the rights and permissions to submit content to the Services.
- You should avoid submitting sensitive information unless necessary and permitted.

We may maintain internal audit records of AI calls (for example, request/response payloads, token usage, timestamps, and status) to support reliability, debugging, cost tracking, and abuse prevention.

## 7. Data Retention
We retain information for as long as needed to provide the Services and for legitimate business purposes, such as:
- Maintaining your account and access controls.
- Preserving records for security, compliance, audits, and dispute resolution.
- Operating backups and disaster recovery.

Retention periods vary depending on the type of data, how it is used, and legal requirements. We may retain and use aggregated or de-identified information for longer periods where permitted by law.

## 8. Security
We use administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect information, including access controls and least-privilege principles. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure; therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 9. Your Choices and Rights
Your rights depend on where you live and how you use the Services.

### 9.1 Account Controls
You may be able to access or update certain profile information through the Services or your authentication provider.

### 9.2 Access, Deletion, and Correction
You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information, subject to applicable laws and legitimate exceptions (for example, security and compliance retention).

### 9.3 California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA)
If you are a California resident, you may have rights to know, access, correct, and delete personal information, and to opt out of “sale” or “sharing” in certain contexts. We do not sell personal information in the ordinary sense. If we engage in practices that constitute “sale” or “sharing” under applicable law, we will provide appropriate choices.

### 9.4 European Privacy Rights (GDPR/UK GDPR)
If you are in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to certain processing, and to request portability. Where we rely on consent, you may withdraw it at any time.

To exercise rights, contact us using the details in Section 1. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling a request.

## 10. International Transfers
We may process and store information in countries other than your own. When required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers (for example, contractual protections).

## 11. Children’s Privacy
The Services are not directed to children under 13 (or the age required by local law), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us personal information, contact us so we can take appropriate action.

## 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version and revise the “Last updated” date. If required by law, we will provide additional notice or obtain consent.
