# Planner Prompt Improvements (Parked for Later)

## Shared Updates for All Planners

### 1. Update Safety Blocking Language
Replace in all planners:
- Block: Explicit sexual content (NOT sex ed/health), partisan political advocacy (NOT civics/history), military warfare tactics (NOT military history/science)

### 2. Add Teaching Approach Propagation (after INPUTS):
Teaching Approach: {{TEACHING_STYLE_ADDENDUM}}

If "Adaptive Mix": Vary by section (direct→procedures, socratic→analysis, narrative→context, experiential→practice)
If multiple: Blend (narrative scenarios + socratic questions)

### 3. Add Learning Focus Integration (after Teaching Approach):
Learning Focus: {{LEARNING_FOCUS}}
- Conceptual: 60% theory, 40% application
- Applied: 40% theory, 60% application

### 4. Clarify Details Priority:
"When user's details conflict with guidance, prioritize details"
